Decision Tree
A Decision Tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It splits the dataset into smaller subsets based on feature values, forming a tree-like structure with decision nodes and leaf nodes that represent outcomes.

* Root Node: The first splitting point, based on the best feature (highest Information Gain or lowest Gini).
* Internal Nodes: Further splits based on other features.
* Leaf Nodes: Final decision nodes — they output the class label.

# Entropy
 Entropy measures the impurity or disorder of a dataset.
 
# Gini Index
 The Gini index is a metric used in decision tree algorithms to evaluate the quality of a split. It quantifies the impurity of a dataset.

 # Information Gain
 Information gain is a metric used in machine learning, particularly in decision tree algorithms, to evaluate how much a feature helps in classifying or predicting the target variable. It quantifies the reduction in uncertainty (entropy) achieved by splitting the data based on that feature. A higher information gain for a feature indicates that it is more useful for making accurate predictions.
